Hi, I am a 20y/o South Korean, currently pursuing Bachelor's Degree in mechanical engineering at KAIST!
# My Interests
My biggest interests revolve around having fun by creating new things. These require skill sets such as Mechatronics and Robotics, which I am mainly working on. Despite being a mechanical engineering student, I love to venture into completely new areas such as:
- Machine learning
- ML Compilers
- Mobile app development
- Embedded programming
- Graphics stuff
- And many more!
# Programming Stack
- C, C++, Rust
- Python(Pytorch, Numpy, Pandas)
- Basic JS/TS (nothing fancy)
- Mobile App Dev (Flutter/Dart)
- Obviously MatLAB, for my linear algebra assignments
# Achievements
- KYPT (Korea Young Physicists’ Tournament: Grand Prize, 2019)
- KPS (Korea Physical Society) Spring Meeting Poster Presentation (2019)
  - Physical Characterizations of Gallium Modified Zinc Oxide Ceramics
- ICAE Poster Presentation (International Conference on Advanced Electromaterials, 2019)
